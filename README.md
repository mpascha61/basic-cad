## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Evidence

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Fork

### Description
This is the "fork" of the caster
### Evidence
[Fork](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/a0fe91082d7fc43f5e50d3b8/w/a0d46cf4802c52b5b1fafefd/e/e9897347fb3631be38c86315)

### Reflection
I learned how to do fillets to make surfaces rounded, I can choose how much I want sides to be cut

## Tire

### Description
This is what the wheel will go into 
### Evidence
[Wheel](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/cfa514728a95d9c4e30b90a6/w/482b877e159a13e4f56353df/e/78054b8e86e6f0f15cab3d4a)

### Reflection
I made a simple shape and used the revolve feature to turn it into a tire, I also used fillets again to round it out
---


## Wheel

### Description
This is what goes in the tire, it will help the caster to turn

### Reflection
I used circular patterns for the first time which basically mirror images around a circular area
I also used fillets to round it out

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
This is the axle of the wheel, it makes it turn
### Evidence

### Reflection
I used the mirror feature to relfect a cut I made and used a coincident relation to stick 2 parts together

### Sub Assembly

### Description
This is the partial assembly of the caster
### Evidence
